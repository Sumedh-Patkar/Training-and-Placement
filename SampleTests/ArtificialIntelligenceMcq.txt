c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned

2. What is state space?
a) The whole problem
b) Your Definition to a problem
c) Problem you design
d) Representing your problem with variable and parameter

3.The problem-solving agent with several immediate options of unknown value can decide what to do by just examining different possible sequences of actions that lead to states of known value, and then choosing the best sequence. This process of looking for such a sequence is called Search. State True or False

a) Input, output
b) Problem, solution
c) Solution, problem
d) Parameters, sequence of actions

5. A problem in a search space is defined by one of these state.
a) Initial state
b) Last state
c) Intermediate state
d) All of the above

6. The Set of actions for a problem in a state space is formulated by a ___________
a) Intermediate states
b) Initial state
c) Successor function, which takes current action and returns next immediate state
d) None of the mentioned


7. A solution to a problem is a path from the initial state to a goal state. Solution quality is measured by the path cost function, and an optimal solution has the highest path cost among all solutions. State whether true or false.
a) True
b) False

8. The process of removing detail from a given state representation is called______
a) Extraction
b) Abstraction
c) Information Retrieval
d) Mining of data

9. A problem solving approach works well for
